# Double Pendulum Solver

Welcome to a little side project of mine! The purpose here was to learn about solving differential equations by create a simulation of the double pendulum by deriving it's equations of motion and solving it with a homemade Runga Kutta solver.

The simulation and solver, is written in Lua, because I like Lua a lot. When you run it with Love2D you get a graphical display of the double pendulum running quite happily, as shown below.

Furthermore I've included an iPython notebook explaining the derivation of the equations and motion, and in the process teaching myself Sympy!
